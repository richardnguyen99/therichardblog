    <h3>About this site</h3>
    <p>
      I&apos; created this website as my digital notebooks that I write down every struggle and
      solution I experience during my learning journey. It helps me know what the problem is and how
      I solve it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also want to share what I know with everyone who is having the same problem as I have
      before. So they learn another solution to solve the problem, or they give me some feedback to
      correct or improve my solution.
